# TimesheetHelper

**This add-on forces the user of Synectics timesheets to enter all weekday billable hours and explainations. This is useful for dummies like me who occasionally do stupid things like focus on filling in the work descriptions but completely forget to fill in the hours worked. Once the submit button is pressed the timesheet cannot be edited. One must wait for HR to re-enable the timesheet. This is less than ideal since the response doesn't happen until the next week after timesheets are past due.**

## What it does

This extension finds prompts for each weekday billable hours field, defaulting to 8 if parsing of the input fails. It also prompts for the explaination for each each workday's efforts. Some color changes serve as basic progress indicators.
